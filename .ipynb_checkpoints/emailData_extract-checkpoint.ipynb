We all lose things. I once went for a pint with the late Keith Floyd and he lost an entire week.Another time I worked out an equation for cold fusion and gave it to my cat on a memory stickwhich she lost.

For this reason we suggest that you contact them directly and take meter readings the day you move into the property.

When you first applied to switch to us everything went fine but after a few days we received an information from the industry that the postcode assigned to your household on the national gas database  is incorrect and thus your switch was stopped. We tried out best to fix the issue internally but it looks like our systems won't allow us to take the supply on board until the record is corrected on the national database. The postcode assigned to your gas supply in Xoserve is SK VV. This must have been assigned incorrectly when the first meters were installed in the area.

You'll have to forgive me for forgetting to ask for your name Sorry about that So we can update the account accurately for West Road Reigate RH JT there's a few more bits of information we'll need. We'll need to know what date you became responsible for the property and to provide any meter readings for the property you may have taken from that date. This sin't always the date that you moved in but begins when your tenancy agreement began. We would also need any contact information you have for the landlordletting agency for the property so we can chase up any gaps in tenancy with them. In addition to this we need a telephone contact number for you an email address and we'd need to know if you'd like any named secondaries on the account so they'll be able to discuss the account with us if they contact us. As it stands you're currently on our Out Of Contract rates. These rates are variable and there is a higher standing charge compared to our fixed tariff. I have used the estimated annual usage of the property to generate a quote of £ a month on our current fixed rate tariff So Koala. There is also the option to make monthly seasonal payments. This means you can pay a little bit less in the summer months and a little bit more in the winter months but it works out to be exactly the same amount over the contract if you were paying the £ a month. The monthly seasonal payments would be £. per month from April to September. Then £. per month from October to March. I have included the rates of our So Koala tariff below: Gas standing charge : . All prices are inclusive of VAT. There is a day cooling off period from the day you agree to the tariff so if you change your mind within days you can cancel your change to the new tariff without incurring any early exit fees. I would kindly ask you to contact us and advise if you would like to sign up to a month fixed rate So Koala tariff and whether you would prefer to make the flat rate monthly payments or the monthly seasonal payments. We can then set up a Direct Debit mandate so monthly payments can be made towards your usage. I look forward to hearing back from you. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.

       " '5\\tI sent a message recently regarding my energy usage. Unfortunately the response did not provide me with the detail I need. I have a suspicion that a neighbour may be stealing electricity. He has two homes and I noticed earlier last year that my electricity usage jumped when he was staying in the property neighbouring mine. To confirm whether or not my suspicion is well-founded I made a point in the latter part of the year to take and submit my meter readings on the day he arrived and the day he left the neighbouring property. I was hoping to check my energy usage graph on the So.Energy website to see if there was a similar jump showing in my usage for the period that he was present next door. Unfortunately when I was transferred to the So Koala tariff the website stopped giving me access to the energy usage chart for the preceding months. Is there any way that you could generate the energy usage chart for me for the months prior to transferring to the So Koala tariff Without this I will have to either wait another months to identify whether electricity is being stolen or have to find an alternative method .
